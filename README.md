💬 BiteSpeed Frontend Chatbot Flow Builder Assignment
Overview

Let's get those chatbot conversations flowing! In this React-powered(Ahem,, Next.js) project, I have developed a user-friendly chatbot flow builder with extensibility and simplicity of code and architecture in mind. ✨

👉 I have leveraged the awesome reactflow.dev: https://reactflow.dev/ library for the visual flow building experience & have used Shadcn/UI: https://ui.shadcn.com/ for the UI(minimial and aeshetically beautiful)

Features

💬 Text Nodes: The foundation of your chatbot conversations. Add as many as you need!
🔌 Nodes Panel: Your toolbox for building awesome flows. Right now, we've got text nodes, but the possibilities are endless.
🔗 Edges: Connect those nodes together for a seamless flow.
☝️ Source Handles: Where your conversational journeys begin (only one edge per source, please!).
🎯 Target Handles: The destination for your edges (they can handle multiple connections).
⚙️ Settings Panel: Customize your selected node – for now, it's all about editing that text content.
💾 Save Button: Lock in your brilliant flow design. Just watch out for those empty target handles - the save button won't be happy about them! 😉
Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then:

Let the flow-building fun begin!

**💬Frontend Chatbot Flow Builder**

**Overview**

Let's get those message nodes flowing! In this React-powered (more specifically, Next.js) project, I've developed a user-friendly chatbot flow builder with extensibility, simplicity of code, and architecture in mind. ✨

👉 I've leveraged the awesome reactflow.dev ([https://reactflow.dev/](https://reactflow.dev/)) library for the visual flow-building experience and Shadcn/UI ([https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/)) for a minimal and aesthetically pleasing UI.

**Features**

* 💬 **Text Nodes:** The foundation of your chatbot conversations. Add as many as you need!
* 🔌 **Nodes Panel:** Your toolbox for building awesome flows. Right now, we've got text nodes, but the possibilities are endless.
* 🔗 **Edges:** Connect those nodes together for a seamless flow.
* ☝️ **Source Handles:** Where your conversational journeys begin (only one edge per source, please!).
* 🎯 **Target Handles:** The destination for your edges (they can handle multiple connections).
* ⚙️ **Settings Panel:** Customize your selected node – for now, it's all about editing that text content.
* 💾 **Save Button:** Lock in your brilliant flow design. Just watch out for those empty target handles - the save button won't be happy about them! 😉

**Getting Started**

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then:

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm/pnpm install` or `yarn install`
3. `npm/pnpm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Let the flow-building fun begin!

**Packages 📦**

I've used these libraries to make the magic happen:

* Next.js 14
